# Turbo Vulkan Engine

There will be a Game engine written in C++ using Vulcan.

# Prerequisites
`todo`

# GDB customizations:
If you want to use custom pretty printers, you need to add project path to GDB's auto-load safe-path. 
You can do that by adding `set auto-load safe-path <ProjectRoot>` to `~/.gdbinit`.
