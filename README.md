# Turbo Vulkan Engine

There will be a Game engine written in C++ using Vulcan.

# Prerequisites

> The Intel's Sponza is too big to keep it on Git repo, so I decided to fetch it using script. Run `FetchAndCompressSponza.py`
to fetch and then compress its textures using AMD's Compesonator.

# GDB customizations:
If you want to use custom pretty printers, you need to add project path to GDB's auto-load safe-path. 
You can do that by adding `set auto-load safe-path <ProjectRoot>` to `~/.gdbinit`.
